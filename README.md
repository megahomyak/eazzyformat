# EazzyFormat
Format made by me, megahomyak. Used to store states in FAQ telegram bot for Eazzy (scooter rental company).

This library has no requirements and can be installed as `pip install eazzyformat`

List is `[element element element]`. Element can be a `"string"` or `["another" "list"]`.

Maybe I'll add numbers later.

EazzyFormat objects are being translated to Python objects: lists and strings.
